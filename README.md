Image-Steganography-and-Cryptography

Design a Steganography system which is hiding a small text message carried by graphical image
from human beings using the LSB algorithm. Moreover, adding a layer of security by
making use of Cryptography using Affine Cipher Algorithm which will encrypt the small text
message. This system will enable the user to send a message to the server without it being detected
by the intruders.
